# Doshii Partner SDK [![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url] [![Build Status][travis-image]][travis-url] [![Dependency Status][daviddm-image]][daviddm-url]
> A wrapper for the Doshii Partner API

Our API has been designed specifically to provide seamless integration into any POS, whether cloud or legacy. Built on the cloud, our SSL-secure API provides two-way communication between the POS and any app integrated with Doshii. Simply put, we're connecting hospitality.

Looking to integrate? Check us out at [Doshii.io](http://doshii.io) and one of our awesome staff will hook you up with an API key.

A breakdown of all the methods available are available on the [wiki](https://github.com/yjimk/doshii-sdk/wiki) page

## Installation

```sh
$ npm install --save doshii-sdk
# or
$ yarn add doshii-sdk
```

## Usage

Your clientId and clientSecret will be picked up by default if they're set in your environment variables as 'DOSHII_CLIENT_ID' and 'DOSHII_CLIENT_SECRET', both or none must be set.

I would suggest only using the default 'v3' for version.  Specifying 'v2' will work for some of these methods, but reliability may be lacking.

```js
// Initialize the library
const Doshii = require('doshii-sdk')({
  clientId: 'YOUR_DOSHII_CLIENT_ID',
  clientSecret: 'YOUR_DOSHII_CLIENT_SECRET',
  env: 'sandbox',
  version: 'v3'
})

// The above settings would result in a base path of https://sandbox.doshii.co/partner/v3
```

Both promises and callbacks are supported by this library
```js
Doshii.Locations.retrieveAll()
  .then((result) => {
    // Do awesome stuff here
  }).catch((err) => {
    // Manage any errors here
  })

Doshii.Locations.findMenu({
  locationId: 'HASHED_LOCATION_ID' // Required
}, (err, result) => {
  if (err) // Manage any errors here
  // Do awesome stuff here
})
```

## WebSockets

On initialization, a connection to the Doshii WebSocket server will be established.

## Contributing

We LOVE PRs. Contribution is the foundation of open source and what makes the development community so great.

In saying that, it would really help out a bunch if you follow a few guidelines before submitting a PR for this repo.

- Please update/create then run tests (check out the /test folder). You'll need a DOSHII_CLIENT_ID and DOSHII_CLIENT_SECRET set as environment variables.
- Please keep the coding style consistent. If you use eslint, the standard babel config is being used and will be applied when installing dependencies for this repo. Simply put, we use spaces, no trailing semi-colons and prefer nice thin functions/conditionals where reasonable.
